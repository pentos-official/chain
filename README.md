# Standard Chain 

![banner](./assets/interchain-standards-image.jpg)

## Synopsis

This repository is the canonical location for development and documentation of inter-chain standards utilised by the PentOS network & interchain ecosystem.

It shall be used to consolidate design rationale, protocol semantics, and encoding descriptions for the inter-blockchain protocol (IBC), including both the core transport, authentication, & ordering layer (IBC/TAO) and the application layers describing packet encoding & processing semantics (IBC/APP).

Contributions are welcome.

The rendered, ordered set of all interchain standards written so far can be read as [a single PDF](./spec.pdf).

## Ecosystem

For a list of IBC implementations, IBC-supporting blockchains, and special IBC bridges, see [ECOSYSTEM.md](./ECOSYSTEM.md).

To add your project to this list, submit a pull request.

Learn more about the [IBC Ecosystem Working Group](./ecosystem/README.md).

Check out a list of [frequently asked questions](./ibc/6_IBC_FAQ.md).

## Standardisation

Please see [ICS 1](spec/ics-001-ics-standard) for a description of what a standard entails.

To propose a new standard, [open an issue](https://github.com/PentOS/ics/issues/new).

To start a new standardisation document, copy the [template](spec/ics-template.md) and open a PR.

See [PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md) for a description of the standardisation process.

Learn more about the [IBC Steering Committee](./org/steering/README.md).

## IBC Quick References

If you are planning to review inter-blockchain communication protocol specifications, the following are required reading:

-   [IBC Terminology](./ibc/1_IBC_TERMINOLOGY.md)
-   [IBC Architecture](./ibc/2_IBC_ARCHITECTURE.md)
-   [IBC Design Principles](./ibc/3_IBC_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md)

Translated versions of some of these documents can be found in the [translation](./translation) folder.
